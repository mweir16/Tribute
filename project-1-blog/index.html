        <h2 id="beaches">The Beaches</h2>

        <p>
            To get to the beaches you have to travel over the causeway, either in Jensen Beach or Stuart, the causeways
        bring you over the Indian River and to Hutchinson Island where all the beaches are located.
        </p>

            The most popular (and most crowded) beach in Jensen Beach is, well, Jensen Beach, Beach. There is
        a little cafe located there and is the only beach that really has something like that. Most beaches on
        the island do not have any kind of concession stands, mostly to avoid litter.

        <p>
             There are a lot of little, less known beaches, as you venture up and down the island. The dog beach,
        Walton Rocks is a good place to go if you want to play around with some other dogs. My dog and I prefer
        to go to the inlet at the Jensen Beach causeway. There is a little beach-like area but the water is 
        noticably more calm as it is the river and not the ocean.
         </p>
         <ul><b>More Beaches:</b>
             <li>Blowing Rocks</li>

        <p>
              Like I mentioned above the Jensen causeway is a popular place for people to go and hang out.
    You can put your boat in the water, go fishing, there are benches, picnic tables, pavilions, and in one 
    of the pull offs there is also a play ground.  
         </p>

        <p>
            Back on the mainland there's also Indain River Park, another great place to check out. It has a lake to walk around, 
        trails, another little swimming/beach area in the Indian river, a fountain, theres even a kids museum there.
        They also have an outside ampitheater area for summer concerts.
        </p>

        <p>
            A little farther into Jensen Beach theres a small trail with a dog park that we frequent often, Haney 
        Creek Trail. We (the dog and I) can't go swimming in the lakes at this park because of all the wildlife.
        Alligators love the still warm water and are known to be seen here, though we haven't seen any gators we have seen
        plenty of turtles
        </p>

             If you're looking for something out of the sun, or it's one of those crazy storm days, there is plenty 
        of shopping, eating and indoor activities as well.

        <h2 id="eating">The Eating</h2>

        <p>
             Over on the island there are a couple places that are always busy and well liked. 
       <a href="http://www.shuckersgrill.com/">Shuckers</a> is a nice place right on the beach, they have indoor and outdoor dining as well as a 
        bar inside and out. Their french fries are honestly some of the best fries I've ever had and I dont know why.
        </p>

        <p>
             Also on the island there is <a href="http://www.surfsidejensenbeach.com/">Surfside Grill & Pizza</a>. Finding good pizza in florida after growing up
        in New York & Connecticut (where the best pizza in the world is) was such a relief I didn't know I needed. Everything 
        on their menu is awesome too, the size of everything is so big. They have a nice little outdoor area where your
        dogs are welcome to join you for your meal.
         </p>

        <p>
             Back over the bridge there a cool little place <a href="https://conchyjoes.com/">Conchy Joe's</a>, although I guess it's not so little 
        anymore since they are expanding. They are right on the Indian river and have docks for you to pull 
        up on your boat, they always have some kind of live music going on Thursday-Saturday, Tuesdays 
        is trivia and Wednesdays they do hermit crab racing! It's definatly a fun place with both indoor and outdoor seating 
        and bars as well.  
        </p>

    <div>
        <h2 id="shop">& Plenty of Shopping</h2>

         <p>
            There really is almost anything you could want down here, depending on how far you are willig 
        to travel, but right here in Jensen is plenty of staples anyone would need. There's the mall, with the 
        department stores, food court and movie theater. Of Course we have a Target, Walmart, and Sams club. 
        Michaels, Barnes & Noble, really plenty of shopping.
        </p>  

        <p>
            There are also a bunch of really nice shops and boutiques in downtown Jensen and downtown Stuart (the next town over), 
        where they also have an outdoor/indoor flea market every weekend.
